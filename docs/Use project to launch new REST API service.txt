### How To: Launch new REST service project using this as base  ###

Step 1: Make sure you have required tools on development machine
See "Configuring required tooling.txt" file


Step 2: Create New GitHub or Git Project
Ex: https://github.com/ -> Login -> + New Repository


Step 3: Copy or Mirror "Express Serverless REST API Base Project" Git Repo as starting point
mkdir BaseRESTServiceProject && cd BaseRESTServiceProject
git clone --bare https://github.com/derekgebhard/project_name.git
cd old-repository.git
git push --mirror https://github.com/exampleuser/new-repository.git
cd ..
rm -rf old-repository.git


Step 4: Pull down your Git Repo (clone repo locally) and install dependencies
git clone <URL for Git repo. ex: https://github.com/derekgebhard/your_project_name.git>
npm install

Step 5: Setup AWS Account(s)
https://aws.amazon.com/s/dm/optimization/server-side-test/free-tier/free_np/
Note: You can either do separate ones for each stage (dev, gamma, prod) which is typical or
a single AWS account for all stages.


Step 6: Configure AWS Credentials and IAM accounts for each AWS Account
Details: https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/
Navigate to AWS Console -> IAM
Create New User with programmatic access and Admin Privileges
Note: Never check in credentials to GIT


Step 7: Setup AWS Creds on machine (Severless uses to deploy and work)
Requires AWS CLI
Run "aws configure" and "aws configure --profile <profile name ex:devo>" to setup credentials locally
You will need to do this configure command for devo, gamma, prod profiles for all stages to work.
You may want to make note of your credentials for other devs that will work on project.
Note: Never check in credentials to GIT


Step 8: Add email address for alarms to either AWS Parameter Store or CloudFormation script
Option1: Open resources/cloudwatch-alarms-dashboards.yml. Change line 8 from {{resolve:ssm:AlarmEmail:2}}
to your email address. I would advise against this if checking into a public repo because it exposes
this email address.
Option 2: Add your email address to AWS -> System Manager -> Parameter Store.  Sign into AWS Console. Navigate to
Systems Manager. Click Parameter Store in Left Menu under Shared Resources. Click Create Parameter. For name
use AlarmEmail. Keep type as String and enter your preferred email for Alarms in value. Click Create parameter.
You will receive a verification email to this address after initial deployment.
Note: I forward my emails to my phone's text messages via provider text email address. You can also change the
cloudformation script to sms for "-protocol" on line 7 and replace the email with your mobile phone #.


Step 9: Change Service Name/Git Location to Your Project Name and Location
Name: serverless.yml line 3, package.json line 2, README.md line 1
Description: package.json line 4, README.md
Git Info: package.json line 23, 27, 29, 31


Step 10: Setup Stages
sls offline start, sls deploy --stage dev, sls deploy --stage gamma, sls deploy --stage prod
Make note of all the REST service paths for each stage from console of these commands
Update package.json lines 7-10 with paths for each stage. These are used for integration tests.
    "config": {
      "localPath": "http://localhost:3000",
      "devPath": "https://u8ts2erx64.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev",
      "gammaPath": "https://vdre8soovb.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/gamma",
      "prodPath": ""
    }
You can check everything is working for each stage with integration tests
npm run <localIntegrationTests or devIntegrationTests or gammaIntegrationTests or prodIntegrationTests>
Note: You may want to hold off on prod until you are ready for production given it has small recurring
charges to keep lambda's warm. You can remove app and AWS resources via: sls remove (same as severless remove) and
sls remove --stage prod


Step 11: Commit Your Changes
git add *
git commit -m "Initial REST API Service Setup"
git push origin


Stp 12: You are now ready to Make, Commit, and Deploy Changes
