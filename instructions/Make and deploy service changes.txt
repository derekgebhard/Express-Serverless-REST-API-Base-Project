### How To: Make and Deploy Service Changes ###

Step 1: Make Code Changes
a. Modify your supported REST API paths/routes in src/server.js
b. Add your route handlers in src/routes
c. Add any models/business logic/etc in src
d. Add Unit Tests under unitTests/ using convention filename.test.js
e. Update integration tests in integrationTests/server.test.js


Step 2: Check that latest changes pass all Unit Tests and hit code coverage bar
a. npm test
b. Check that latest changes have code coverage:
   npm run coverage


Step 3: Check latest changes pass local integration tests
sls offline start
npm run localIntegrationTests


Step 4: Commit Code to Git Repo
git add *
git commit -m "Commit Message"
git push origin master
Note: This will change depending on branching, release management strategy


Step 5. Deploy Service to Dev and sure Integration Tests Pass
Navigate to code to deploy to dev
sls deploy --stage dev
npm run devIntegrationTests


Step 6: Deploy Service to Gamma  and sure Integration Tests Pass
sls deploy --stage gamma
npm run gammaIntegrationTests


Step 7: Deploy Service to Prod. Validate prod is working properly
a. Deploy: sls deploy --stage prod
b. Check Integration Tests Pass: npm run prodIntegrationTests
c. Keep Monitoring Dashboards: Coming Soon
d. Keep Monitoring Logs: AWS Console -> CloudWatch -> Logs -> Click LogGroup:
"	/aws/lambda/<serviceName>-prod-app"

ROLLING BACK PRODUCTION SHOULD ANY ISSUES HAPPEN:
sls deploy list --stage prod
serverless rollback --timestamp <timestamp>
